This repo contains the CMP 3060 tutorials. It include tutorials for the Computer graphics and Human Computer Inmteraction course. Including well explanatory comments for  the code.

# Outlines
## Triangle using Shaders
- Drawing a triangle using vertex and fragment shaders.
- Uniforms are used to send time to make the traingle shrink and expand by time.
- For this exercise data of the triangles is hard-coded inside the shaders.

## Triangle using Buffers
- Array Buffers are used to send data from main.cpp to the shaders instead of hard-coding them into shaders.
